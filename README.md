Writing a program that simulates, and hopefully animates, a newton's cradle, for module PHYS389 at Lancaster University. PHYS389: Computer Modelling is intented to build upon previous Computer Modelling techniques from PHYS281, and introduce more advanced programming techniques. The aim is to not only write a program to simulate and animate a newtons cradle, but to be able to anaylse the simulation and test it's accuracy. The aim is too write a program that is adaptable to user inputs, in this case those inputs being number of balls, and the string length. As there is an analytic solution for pendulum motion with a small angle approximation, this should not be used - instead there should be numerical calculations at a given time interval in order to obtain an approximation to real motion. From this, the effect of changing the time intervals can be analysed.

The first objective is to be able to be able to simulate a simple pendulum, extending to a damped pendulum. Next objective is to model collisions, before then attempting to combine the two.
