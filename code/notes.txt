This page is just to keep track of things that need doing, and random thoughts:
- slightly unsure about how the collisions program will deal with corners, however that won't be relevant to the larger project anyway

- as the current pendulum method is an ODE solver, nothing to do with forces, combining may be awkward
    - current idea is to to check for overlap at every point somehow? then the starting point and velocity of the angular motion can be then calculated in a similar way to the velocity after collision

- to do:
    - simple pend   (done)
    - animate simple pend (done)
    - damped pend + animate (done)
    - collisions + animate (done)
    - combine (in progress)
        - currently changing from a ODE based method to a forces based method for calculating momenta
            - this will make combining much easier (done)
        - plot to check if results are sensible
        - add an enumerate so that balls have a label?
    - find things to analyse (consv of momentum, energy, how changing time step effects things etc)
    - ensure that enough "advanced coding methods" are present
        - read up on what counts as advanced coding methods
