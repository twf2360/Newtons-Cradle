class results:
    '''
    This is a class that accesses functions from within the calculator class, and prints the results using pandas dataframes
    The calculator class is accessed multiple times, so that results can be compared

    The results class contains four class methods:
        - collision_df generates a dataframe for all of the collisions that take place for every possible configuration described in the config file 
        - time_to_run_df generates a dataframe for the time to run each configuration described in the config file
        - conservation_df generates a dataframe that investigates the conservation of energy of each system configuration

        - all_three_dfs generates all three of the previously defined functions. The reason these methods are combined is so that the calculator class does not have to perform
        repeat calculations - this dramatically shortens the time taken to generate the dataframes. Becuase of this, all_three_dfs is the class method that is called by main.py
