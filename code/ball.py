class ball:
    '''
    class used to define the balls involved in the simulation.
    This class is used by all of the other classes:
        - calculator.py uses the update functions (euler_update, cromer_update, and runge_kutta2) to update the positions and velocities of the balls based on the accelerations it calculated
        - calculator.py requires the position, velocity, mass, and anchor points of the balls to calculate the change in acceleration
        - calculator.py uses the overlap function to determine when a collision between balls has taken place

        - plotter.py uses the position attribute of the ball object to plot the balls position over time 
        - plotter.py uses the energy functions - kinetic and potential - to plot the energy of the system over time
